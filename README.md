Odin Project : Landing Page

This is an assignment from the foundation course for The Odin Project.
It summarises HTML, CSS and Flexbox. 

It was an interesting project and there was so much googling but was fun.
Will come back to this once I have designed out my very own ideal site. 

For this assignment, the page can be viewed here.
